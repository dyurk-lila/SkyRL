"""Pure-Python (torch-only) coercion of Megatron optimizer ``*_dtype`` kwargs.

logic can be unit-tested on the cheap CPU CI lane (which installs torch but not
megatron-core). ``optimizer.py`` imports the public helper from here.

# ('bfloat16', 'float16'/'half', 'float32'/'float', 'float8'/'uint8') accept the
# spellings a user might reasonably write in YAML. ``fp8`` maps to ``torch.uint8``

# ``exp_avg_dtype`` / ``exp_avg_sq_dtype`` additionally allow bf16/fp8.
# ``main_grads_dtype`` is deliberately NOT listed: at the pinned megatron-core rev
# it is not forwarded to FusedAdam (see megatron/core/optimizer/__init__.py, which
# only passes exp_avg_dtype, exp_avg_sq_dtype, and main_params_dtype as
# master_weight_dtype), so there is no TE-backed legal set to enforce — it is still
# coerced str->dtype here and left for ``OptimizerConfig.__post_init__`` to validate
# (mirroring how ``params_dtype`` is handled: coerced, not field-validated).

    but SkyRL forwards ``optimizer_config_kwargs`` verbatim from YAML/Hydra, which
    delivers plain strings (e.g. ``"bf16"``). This converts any ``*_dtype`` key whose
    value is a dtype-name string into the corresponding ``torch.dtype`` using Megatron-LM's
    canonical mapping, validates the result against the per-field legal set, and leaves
    everything else (non-``*_dtype`` keys, values already ``torch.dtype``) untouched.

    Returns a new dict; the input is not mutated.
